**A Multivariate Predictive Model for Estimating Calorie Burn Based on Physiological Signals**

**Project Overview:**

This research aims to develop an accurate and personalized model for estimating caloric expenditure during physical activity by integrating a range of physiological and demographic variables. Traditional methods often rely on generalized estimations that overlook individual variability. By adopting a data-driven approach grounded in physiological science, this project seeks to model energy expenditure with higher precision, contributing to advancements in personalized health monitoring, fitness tracking, and metabolic research.

**Objectives:**

1.	To design and implement a predictive model that leverages features such as age, gender, height, weight, heart rate, body temperature, and duration of activity to estimate individual calorie burn with high accuracy.
2.	To analyse and quantify the relative impact of each input variable on energy expenditure, identifying key predictors and exploring their interdependencies through statistical and machine learning techniques.
